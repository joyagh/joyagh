## About Me 🌱

I'm a passionate full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript. Having recently completed the curriculum at Codex Academy, I'm equipped with a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end development. I take immense pride in my work, constantly honing my skills, and finding joy in delivering elegant solutions through code.

In addition to my technical proficiency, I bring experience in caregiving, customer service, and data entry, which has provided me with a unique perspective and a strong foundation in problem solving and effective communication.

I'm confident in my ability to navigate challenges and make meaningful contributions to the success of any team or project.

Let's collaborate to create solutions that make a difference!
